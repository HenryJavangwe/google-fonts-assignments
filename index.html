                Today we learnt on how to create google forms, various input methods and how to add css to our pages<br>
                and how to create a speechbox using css. I was a bit slow on the uptake but I eventually started getting warmed up<br>
                I just need more practice on those and I will be good.

                A few months ago i couldn't see myself as a programmer but now...<br>
                I have discovered my passion in tech and i am really enjyoing what i am studying
                it's really interesting and the whole process of creating something and putting it out there
                That is what I call art, expressionalism and freedom. Doing something you enjoy is just blissful.
